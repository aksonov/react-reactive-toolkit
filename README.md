# React Reactive toolkit

Inspired by [bacon.react.html](https://github.com/polytypic/bacon.react.html),
[react-combinators](https://github.com/polytypic/bacon.react.html) and
[Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/) but has no external dependencies (instead of React) and works with
any reactive library that is compatible with 
[ECMAScript Observable spec](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-observable)
